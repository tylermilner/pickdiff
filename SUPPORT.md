# Support

Thanks for your interest in PickDiff! This document explains how to get help.

## Before You Ask
- Ensure you're running the latest released version (see `CHANGELOG.md`).
- Search existing GitHub Issues to see if your question or problem is already reported.
- Check the `README.md` for setup, usage, and development instructions.

## Getting Help
If you still need assistance:
1. **Bug Reports**: Open a new issue using the Bug Report template. Include reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, environment details (OS, Node.js version), and screenshots if helpful.
2. **Feature Requests / Enhancements**: Use the Feature Request template. Describe the problem you're trying to solve and any alternatives you've considered.
3. **Security Concerns**: Do NOT open a public issue. See `SECURITY.md` for private reporting instructions.
4. **General Questions**: Open a "question" issue (choose the Feature Request template and mark it as a question) until Discussions are enabled.

## Response Times
- Security reports: Acknowledged within 48 hours (see `SECURITY.md`).
- Issues / PRs: Typically reviewed within a week.

## Providing a Minimal Reproduction
For complex issues, create a small public test repository (or archive) that reproduces the problem with the fewest files/commits necessary.

## Good Citizenship
- Follow the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
- Be respectful and constructive.
- Provide clear, concise information.

## Commercial / Priority Support
Not available. This is a volunteer-maintained open source project.

## Thank You
